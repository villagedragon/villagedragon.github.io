# Jekyll-Jupyter Blog Template
A template for building a blog, written in Jupyter Notebooks, and using Jekyll.

```

## Configuration
There are only two keys of the Jekyll `_config.yml` file that you really need
to consider:
```yml
high_res_image: "/assets/images/YOUR_HIGH_RES_IMAGE"
low_res_image: "/assets/images/YOUR_LOW_RES_IMAGE"
```

These two *keys* represent the *"high resolution"* and *"low resolution"* versions
of your *background image* (respectively).

## Make
Here we will document the different `make` commands defined in the `Makefile`.
All *commands* (excluding the `all` command which is simply executed by
running `make`) are executed by the following format: `make [COMMAND]`. To see
the *contents* of a command that will be executed upon invocation of the
command, simply run `make -n [COMMAND]`.

### Commands
+ `all`: (*aka*: `make`) defaults to converting all UN-converted notebooks
+ `jupyter`: launches the Jupyter notebook development Docker image
+ `execute`: execute all Jupyter notebooks (in place)
+ `convert`: convert all Jupyter notebooks (even if not changed)
+ `sync`: copy all converted files to necessary directories
+ `jekyll`: startup Docker container running Jekyll server
+ `build-site`: build Jekyll static site
+ `pause`: pause PSECS (to pause between commands)
+ `address`: get Docker container address/port
+ `containers`: launch all Docker containers
+ `commit`: git add/commit all synced files
+ `push`: git push to remote branch
+ `publish`: [ *WARNING* ] convert, sync, commit, and push all at once
+ `list-containers`: list all running containers
+ `stop-containers`: simply stops all running Docker containers
+ `restart-containers`: restart all containers
+ `unsync`: remove all synced files
+ `clear-nb`: simply clears Jupyter notebook output
+ `clear-output`: removes all converted files
+ `clear-jekyll`: removes Jekyll _site/ directory
+ `clean`: combines all clearing commands into one
+ `update-times`: update timestamps to now
+ `reset`: [ *WARNING* ] reverses all changes prior to `commit` command
