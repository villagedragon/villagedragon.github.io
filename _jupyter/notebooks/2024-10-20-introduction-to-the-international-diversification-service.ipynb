    "## What is international diversification ##\n",
    "\n",
    "International diversification refers to allocating assets into diverse global markets, i.e. multiple countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The goal of our international diversification service ##\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Political risk reduction.** Build a safety net against political volatility in any one market, such as war and asset freezing,\n",
    "  \n",
    "+ **Economic risk reduction.** Hedge against domestic market volatility and currency inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Growth potential enhancement.** Benefit from economic growth in different markets, which can lead to improved returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does the service work ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Step one, select foreign countries to invest in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step two, set up bank accounts in the selected countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step three, select ways of investments, such as fixed-income assets, stocks, real estate, currencies, etc.. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential risks with international diversification ##\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Transaction fee.** Higher fees, such as stamp duties, levies, and complex tax for foreign investments, can be involved in the transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Currency volatility.** Exchange rate fluctuations can cause loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Liquidity difficulty.** This is the risk of not being able to sell an investment at any time without risking substantial losses due to a political or economical crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Political instability.** This includes government stability issues such as regimes changes, expropriation or nationalization (e.g. resource nationalization in Bolivia and Venezuela)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering international diversification and selecting countries to invest in, we need to select options that can maximize the achievement of the goal and minimize the risk.\n"
