    "## Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will explore Dubai as an option for international diversification with a goal of political risk reduction, economic risk reduction, and growth potential enhancement. We will explore Dubai from the following angles:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Is Dubai a city or a country?\n",
    "+ Dubai's economic stability\n",
    "+ Dubai's political stability\n",
    "+ How to open a bank account in Dubai as a foreigner?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is Dubai a city or a country ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Dubai is an emirate within the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is a country. In December 1971, the UAE became a federation of six emirates - Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al-Quwain, and Fujairah, while the seventh emirate, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation in 1972. The capital city is Abu Dhabi, located in the largest and wealthiest of the seven emirates. City Dubai is the capital of Emirate Dubai, the most populous emirate of the UAE. \n",
    "\n",
    "The President of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi is His Highness (HH) Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The Ruler of Dubai, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is the Vice-President, Prime Minister, and Defence Minister.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Economic Stability ##\n",
    "\n",
    "The UAE is the Middle East's third largest economy, and one of the wealthiest countries in the region on a per capita basis. Its GDP in 2023 was estimated at US$509 billion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exports of goods and services contribute to 93.9% (2022) of the total GDP (12.2% for the US), because the UAE has 6% of the world's oil reserves and the 7th largest proven natural gas reserves. Petroleum, gold, refined petroleum, broadcasting equipment, and diamonds are the top exports. Petroleum exports were US$94.7 billion in 2023. \n",
    "\n",
    "As in Dubai, in recent years their goverment has been diversifying the market, which has led the GDP contribution of oil production to drop from 50% to less than 1%. In 2018, wholesale and retail trade represented 26% of the total GDP; transport and logistics, 12%; banking, insurance activities and capital markets, 10%; manufacturing, 9%; real estate, 7%; construction, 6%; tourism, 5%. The diversification of the economy in Dubai should provide more stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll look at the economic stability of UAE by comparing the following factors with the US:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ GDP growth rate\n",
    "+ Inflation rate\n",
    "+ Unemployment rate\n",
    "\n",
    "### GDP Growth ###\n",
    "\n",
    "From Figure 1 and 2, we can clearly see that, between 1971 and 2023 the GDP growth rate of the UAE is much more volatile than the US, although the average growth rate of UAE is higher than the US (6.88%±13.09% vs. 2.76%±2.06%, respectively). In the following short periods, it still had similar patterns with the GDP growth of the US: 1981-1986, 1991-1995, 2000-2004, 2007-2010, and 2017-2021. However, overall the GDP growth of the UAE fluctuated more and showed lower correlation to the trend of the GDP growth of the US."
