When the investment reaches 40,000 USD, $\\Delta{N}$ experiences a sharp rise (jumping from less than 1 to over 3.5) because the investment becomes sufficient to qualify for an investor visa, and the cost of living shifts from domestic (1164.3 USD/month) to foreign (532.2 USD/month).

That said, if you have 40,000 USD in spare and are considering relocating to a country with a lower cost of living, investing in Ecuador could potentially offer a significantly greater advantage.

For our 2000-dollar fund, specifically considering the option of certificate of deposit, domestic investment remains the more favorable option.\n",
