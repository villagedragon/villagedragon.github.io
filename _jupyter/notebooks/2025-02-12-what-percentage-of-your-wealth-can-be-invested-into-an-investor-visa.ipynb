However, as we have calculated in section 1, to fulfill the 2-year policy to acquire an investor visa, $p$ has to be equal to or lower than $0.91$. This means, if, for some reason, you want to invest as much as possible into the CD while acquiring an investor visa, the maximum percentage is 91%. Thus you will get 77 additional months from the total wealth in Ecuador than in America. This is significantly lower than the red line, so if your goal is to maximize $\\Delta{N}$, it is not advisable to invest more than $40,000$ USD in the CD.\n",

    "Here you might wonder, what if we only withdraw part of the principal and keep the rest in CD to generate interest? Yes, you can definitely do that, which will offer you even higher $N_{foreign}$, but we'll save that calculation for another article. "

    "The access to lower cost of living and higher interest rate of CD can potentially offer us enormous advantage. Through the above calculation, we will be able to find the right combination of total wealth, required investment, interest rate, and cost of living to optimize the time purchased by the wealth. Even more advantageous, with the right combination of total wealth and interest rate, we can potentially achieve financial freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, the interest rate of CD is not always stable, so as an investor, beyond the purpose of obtaining an investor visa, how can we diversify our portfolio to lower the risk and increase the return? In the following articles, we will be exploring other asset classes."
