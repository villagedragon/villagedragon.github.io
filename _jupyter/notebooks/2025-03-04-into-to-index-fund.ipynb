As a continuation of this series, next we will explore diversification through different asset classes, such as bond, index fund, stock, real estate, etc.. From this article forward, we will introduce one asset class in every article till we have enough knowledge to develop a diversified portfolio with the maximum advantage: low risk and high return.\n",

    "## What is an index fund ##\n",
    "\n",
    "An index fund is a fund that tracks a market index. A market index is a statistical measure that tracks the performance of a specific group of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or other securities, within a financial market. So an index fund itself serves as a diversified portfolio of a particular segment of the market or the market as a whole. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) Index is a mainly market-capitalization-weighted index of 500 leading publicly traded companies in the US. Another example, Dow Jones US Small-Cap Index is a stock market index that tracks the performance of small-capitalization (300 million - 2 billion) companies in the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key features ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Moderate volatility and returns compared to stocks and bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the diversified portfolio, index funds often have lower risk compared to the stocks of individual companies. Meanwhile, index funds aim to match the performance of the market over time, leading to higher returns than conservative asset classes like government or corporate bonds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, as shown in Figure 1, we compared the annual growth of S&P 500 index, Microsoft stocks and 10-year treasury bond between 1987 and 2024. It is obvious that its volatility and annual growth rate is between those of the Microsoft stocks and the treasury bond. Moreover, Figure 2 shows the means and standard deviations of each asset class. The average growth rate and standard deviation of S&P 500 are both lower than Microsoft (12.45%±17.01% vs. 31.84%±42.33%, respectively), but both higher than the treasury bond (4.97%±2.30%).\n"

    "\n",
    "+ P/E ratio\n",
    "  P/E ratio (price-to-earning ratio) measures the relationship between a company's stock price and its earnings per share (EPS). For an index fund, which tracks a specific market index (like the S&P 500), the P/E ratio provides insight into the overall valuation of the stocks within the index. By comparing the current P/E ratio of the index fund with its historical average, and considering other factors such as economic conditions, we can determine if the fund is overvalued or undervalued.\n",
    "+ P/B value\n",
    "  P/B ratio (price-to-book ratio) provides insight into the overall valuation of the stocks within the index relative to their net asset value. It is particularly useful for evaluating value-oriented investments such as utility companies. Book value (total net asset) is often considered a \"floor\" value for a company, as it reflects the theoretical liquidation value. A P/B ratio less than 1 suggests the stock may be undervalued (trading below its book value). Meanwhile, we can compare the current P/B ratio of the index fund with its historical average to determine if the market is overvalued or undervalued."
