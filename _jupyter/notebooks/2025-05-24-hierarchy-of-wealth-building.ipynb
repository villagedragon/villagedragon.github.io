    "\n",
    "+ Level one: \"save 10% of your salary\"\n",
    "\n",
    "  Survive and stabilize by keeping part of what you earn as the foundation of investing.\n",

    "  Grow your savings **steadily** by seeking advice from who are competent. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  <br>\n",

    "+ Level three: \"make gold work for you\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Accelerate the growth by reinvesting the children and grandchildren of your savings to grow a golden army.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the hierarchy of wealth building is crucial for long-term financial success because it prioritizes stability, minimizes catastrophic risks, and optimizes compound growth not only in **wealth itself**, but also the **options** of acquiring wealth. \n",
