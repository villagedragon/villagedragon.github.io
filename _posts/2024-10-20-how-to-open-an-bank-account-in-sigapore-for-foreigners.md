## Introduction ##

In this article, we will introduce Singapore as an option for international diversification. To restate the main goal of our international diversification service: 

+ **Political risk reduction.** Build a safety net against political volatility in any one market, such as war and asset freezing,
  
+ **Economic risk reduction.** Hedge against domestic market volatility and currency inflation.

+ **Growth potential enhancement.** Benefit from economic growth in different markets, which can lead to improved returns.


First we will explore the economic stability and political stability of this country. Then we will explain how to remotely open a bank account in Singapore as a foreigner. 

## Economic Stability of Singapore ##

To understand the economic stability of Singapore, we used the US economy, one of the most dominant forces in the global market, as the control sample to compare the following features: GDP growth, inflation rate, and unemployment rate. 

### GDP growth ###

As shown in Figure 1, the GDP growth rates of Singapore and the US have a similar pattern, which indicates that these two economies are correlated. Meanwhile, Figure 2 shows that both the mean and standard deviation of Singapore GDP growth rate are higher than those of the US, indicating that the GDP of Singapore has been growing faster, but meanwhile it varies more with time and has higher volatility than the GDP of the US.

### Inflation rate ###

In Figure 3, the inflation rates of Singapore and the US from 1961 to 2023 also show a very similar pattern, especially after 1980, which confirms that the economic development of both countries are highly correlated. As for the mean and standard deviation (Figure 4), Singapore's inflation rate is lower than the US on average, but more volatile, especially during 1970-1990. 

Based on [Phillip's curve](), inflation rate should accelerate when the unemployment rate is low. The inflation rate and unemployment rate of both countries confirms this theory.

### Unemployment rate ###

In Figure 5, it shows that the unemployment rate of both countries still share the same pattern during such periods as 2000-2009 and 2017-2023, but during other periods, the unemployment rate of the US is higher and less stable than that of Singapore. The mean and standard deviation in Figure 6 confirmed the above analysis.

### Currency Volatility ###

Currency volatility should be considered if the capital is invested into Singapore as Singapore dollars.

As shown in Figure 8, the average volatility of Singapore dollars is lower than US dollars (4.13% vs. 7.72%), however the standard deviations of both currencies are 1.80% and 2.30%, respectively. This indicates that the volatility of Singapore dollars is lower but the fluctuation is higher on average than US dollars.

In conclusion, the economic stability of Singapore shows very strong correlation to the US economy. As the latter is one of the largest and most powerful economies in the world. It is often referred to as a dominant force in the global market, due to its size, innovation, and resourcefulness. The US economy ranks first in terms of nominal GDP and second in purchasing power parity (PPP). Therefore, Singapore can be regarded as an alternative investment option to the US.

## Political Stability of Singapore ##

Besides the economic stability, political stability is another important factor to consider in our investment decisions, because it directly affects the economic environment and risk foreign investors would face in that country. 

The [Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/worldwide-governance-indicators) are designed to help researchers and analysts assess broad patterns in perceptions of governance across countries and over time. The WGI feature six aggregate governance indicators for over 200 countries and territories over the period 1996–2022:

+ Voice and Accountability
+ Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism
+ Government Effectiveness
+ Regulatory Quality
+ Rule of Law
+ Control of Corruption

Figure 9 shows the percentile ranks of each indicator of Singapore and the US. For both countries, most of their indicators have a higher than 50% rank worldwide. Between these two countries, except Voice and Accountability indicator, all of Singapore's other indicators have higher ranks (close to 100%) than the US's. Therefore, overall Singapore is politically stable.
