## What is international diversification ##

International diversification refers to allocating assets into diverse global markets, i.e. multiple countries. 

## The goal of our international diversification service ##

+ **Political risk reduction.** Build a safety net against political volatility in any one market, such as war and asset freezing,
  
+ **Economic risk reduction.** Hedge against domestic market volatility and currency inflation.

+ **Growth potential enhancement.** Benefit from economic growth in different markets, which can lead to improved returns.

## How does the service work ##

Step one, select foreign countries to invest in.

Step two, set up bank accounts in the selected countries.

Step three, select ways of investments, such as fixed-income assets, stocks, real estate, currencies, etc.. 

## Potential risks with international diversification ##

+ **Transaction fee.** Higher fees, such as stamp duties, levies, and complex tax for foreign investments, can be involved in the transactions.

+ **Currency volatility.** Exchange rate fluctuations can cause loss. 

+ **Liquidity difficulty.** This is the risk of not being able to sell an investment at any time without risking substantial losses due to a political or economical crisis.

+ **Political instability.** This includes government stability issues such as regimes changes, expropriation or nationalization (e.g. resource nationalization in Bolivia and Venezuela)

## Conclusion ##

When considering international diversification and selecting countries to invest in, we need to select options that can maximize the achievement of the goal and minimize the risk.
